Unsubscribe

The .ini file, Unsubscribeconfig .ini, contains 3 config variables: username,password, senders. 

Fill out all variables before running the application. 

When specifying multiple seperate sender names by comma (like: sender = sender1,sender2,sender3). 

If only 1 sender needs to be specified then format should be (like: sender = sender1)

If you want to unsubscribe from all emails set sepecificsender to "none" (like: sender = none)

Screenshots will be taken of the confirmation page after unsubscribing and saved to the Screenshots folder with the name of the Sender as the file name.
